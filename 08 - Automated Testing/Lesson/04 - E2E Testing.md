# E2E Testing

End to end testing is not as tied to the language (Java) or application framework (Spring Boot) as the other types. `Selenium` is a common package used to drive the web browsers and other frameworks will integration it. `protractor` is a tool primary for Angular. `Geb` is a Groovy/Java based tool and can be used to test any front end framework.

E2E testing is beyond the scope of this class.
