# Fibonacci Numbers

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number):

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is:

    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

Write a program to generate the series. Take as user input the count of numbers to generate.
